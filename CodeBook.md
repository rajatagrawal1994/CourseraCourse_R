First we read all the files related to test and train dataset.
Then combine these datasets for all the values, activity and subject into merged dataset.
Then extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
and then we uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Now we labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
